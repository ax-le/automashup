        "This notebook demonstrates an automated approach to creating music mashups. It leverages various libraries and techniques to analyze, process, and combine different musical tracks. The process involves:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Preprocessing:** Extracting key features from input songs, such as beats, downbeats, segments, and key signatures using the `allin1` library.\n",
        "2. **Track Selection:** Choosing specific parts (e.g., vocals, instrumentals) of the songs to be used in the mashup.\n",
        "3. **Mashup Techniques:** Implementing algorithms to synchronize beats, adjust tempo and pitch, and align musical phases between the selected tracks using libraries like `pyrubberband` and `pyloudnorm`.\n",
        "4. **Output:** Generating the final mashup audio file.\n",
        "\n",
        "The notebook provides a flexible framework for experimenting with different mashup strategies and parameters. You can customize the input songs, track selections, and mashup techniques to create your unique mashups.\n",
