# Automashup: Automatic Music Mashups Creation

Hi, and welcome to this GitHub repository, which is the companion repository for the article "Automashup: Automatic Music Mashups Creation," published at the GRETSI 2025 conference.

This repository contains two sub-repositories:
- "app - backend and frontend," that contains the AutoMashup core functions, including the Mashup creation process and the GUI webpage,
- "automatic song selection experiments" that contain the experiments related to the central part of the article, _i.e.,_ how to select pairs of songs that will be blended automatically. 

This repository is a regrouping of two other repositories:
- https://github.com/MichaelMikkles/AutoMashup/
- https://github.com/LeaMyl/Automashup_Mashup_Eval/
which were the practical repositories used for development.
